Responsive Web Design usually uses these languages to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>. The text an element will display goes between its opening and closing tags.

The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements.

Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.

Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->.

HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the main element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.

Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read. This is called nesting. 

You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. An element without a closing tag is known as a void element.

HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).

    Example:    <img src="https://image.svg">

All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

    Example:    <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">

You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element.

A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element.

To open links in a new tab, you can use the target attribute on the anchor (a) element.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. target="_blank" opens the linked document in a new tab or window.

    Example:    <a href="https://github.com/alderrr" target="_blank">Click here</a>

Here is an example of turning an image into a link:

    Example :   <a href="example-link">
                    <img src="image-link.jpg" alt="A photo of a cat.">
                </a>

The section element is used to define sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. It is a semantic element that helps with SEO and accessibility.
